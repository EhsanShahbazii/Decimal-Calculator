# Decimal-Calculator
This is a very small project that shows the answer with many decimal places. With Java and swing.

# Hi friends:hand: 
It must have occurred to you that you want high-precision decimal digits, but the calculators do not show it to you.<br>
It happened to me too and it got on my nerves! That's why I said to fix the calculator when I'm unemployed and to meet this need.<br>
This program is very simple and still needs to debug and correct parts of the program logic. Not finished yet but it does my job very well and from it.<br>
This program is input data in terms of Big Decimal and because of these numbers, it displays a lot of decimals and is very accurate. Performs four main functions,<br>
which are multiplication, division, squatting and subtraction, along with percentage.<br>
This program is written in Java language and its graphics are written by Java Swing. And it has a jar file that can be opened and used without a programming environment.
